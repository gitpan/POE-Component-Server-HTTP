    Make the test for 'close' in the Connection: close case
    insensitive (iPhoto 5 fixup from Dieter MÃ¼cke)

0.06	Sunday 2nd January, 2005
    Added status messages to t/10_run.t
    Added default ErrorHandler, that prints a simple message to STDERR
    Improved detection of keepalive close
    Renamed t/compile.t to t/00_compile.t
    Added t/10_run.t
    Added t/30_error.t
    Added support for ErrorHandler
    Added DEBUG messages to HTTP.pm
    Added ->is_error to response and request objects
    Renamed Handler to Queue to minimize confusion in code.
    Cleaned up sub execute {} where $state was being set at funny places
    Reorganized Map, for ErrorHandler and so that filenames don't get a 
            trailing /
    ->create() now returns a hashref, keys are httpd or tcp, values
    are the session aliases of the respective sessions.
