POE/Component/Server/HTTP
=========================

This is a nearly stable release of PoCo::Server::HTTP It makes it easy to
write HTTP servers in POE.

The design is roughly based on the ideas of mod_perl and lets you
add hooks and intercept in a numbber of different stages.

Look at the test cases in t/ if you want help.  In particular, 
t/20_stream.t contains a good example of multipart/mixed responses.
